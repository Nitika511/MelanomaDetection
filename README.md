# Melanoma Detection
> This project is related to building a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma in the given image dataset. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
This project builds a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. Dataset is taken from the upgrad provided link and contains about 2000 images belonging to 9 different classes of skin diseases.
The aim is to detect whether an image belongs to class "melanoma". 
The metrics used here will be accuracy, and loss used is SparseCategoricalCrossentropy. 



## Technologies Used
- tensorflow version 2.17.0
- keras version 3.6.0
- Augmentor - version 0.2.12
- Pandas - version 2.1.4
